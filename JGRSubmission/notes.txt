----
When converting a latex file into a merged pdf with figures, GEMS will
insert graphics into the merged pdf. We should consult with EJPress
and include instructions in the template on how the author should
upload the latex into GEMS so the merged outputs figures with captions
underneat (that is, so the GEMS merged pdf includes graphics).

We should include instruction in the Word SI template and LaTeX SI
template that authors should upload the formatted PDF instead of the
doc or latex—unless EJPress can export the built PDF…Jeanette, have
they indicated they can? If an author uploads the doc or tex SI
template, that’s what’s published. I think many are not aware of this,
so we should declare it in more places, especially in the
instructional text of the templates. 

>> Let me know if you'd like anything changed regarding these points.

Wiley Production request this text? IF not, we don’t need it.

DOCS.PDF

	Page 1: Authors should also not use \providecommand (in addition to the other macro options listed)
== Done

	Page 2: When will AGU receive the “final version” without the DRAFT option? Does Wiley collect this? 
== ??  I don't know what Wiley will do, but if you don't ask for draft style you will get the final style,
no double spacing and raggedright. \documentclass{agujournal} will give you the final style.

	Can we get an option to single-space the “draft”? Reviewers request this to save paper when printing

==  \documentclass{agujournal} will give you the final style.
See if you like the appearance. I could also make the text width wider or any other change to yield a
   more polished output. Let me know.

	At revision, authors must supply both the “final version”
without markup and the “draft version” with markup. Should we change
this policy, or should Amy add text about making two documents?
== Let me know if you need to change the documentation. The track changes information will
only print in draft mode.

	Page 8: Instructions say to use certain figure extensions
depending on the program they’re using to render the PDF. However, for
revisions and resubmissions, authors don’t give us the rendered PDF,
they give us the source file. The question then becomes, what program
does GEMS use to render the TEX files into PDF? We should encourage
authors to use file extensions that match it. (We use plain LaTeX in
house with varying options on the graphicx package.)

== Let me know what you'd like me to change


Page 11: The Tip at the bottom doesn’t make sense to me;
should the second instance of “figone” instead be “figtwo”?

== Fixed

===============
AGUJOURNALTEMPLATE.TEX
	Line 14: Suggestion to add “ etc.” to cover all bases
== done

AGUJOURNAL.CLS

• Line 57: The TIMES.STY and TIMES package consistently give us errors
about missing a file named MTMACS. I usually wind up disabling it.
Should we be including in the new CLS file?

== I put the text of times.sty into the .cls file. I don't know what is
calling mtmacs, but perhaps this will help.

	Line 1083: I get an undefined control sequence (\refname) when
trying to build any document with a bibliography. Is a delimiter
missing?
== fixed. 



	In journals list, Global Biochemical Cycles should be Global
Biogeochemical Cycles and Water Resource Research should be Water
Resources Research
== done
	
	I tested the template and got the same \refname error that
Nick noted. In the draft format, this prevented the file from printing
any references, either at the end or in-text. In the “final” format,
the references printed fine.
== strange that it would be different depending on draft or final format, but
it is defined now.
	
	Also, in the draft format the figure captions and in-text
figure references didn’t print, but they were fine in the “final”
version.
== would need to see a sample file to figure out what is going on here. Please send.
	
I’m a little confused about the difference between draft and final.
Are we going to ask authors to submit both a draft file (for review)
and a final file (for Wiley) at each revision stage? Or will we ask
them to submit a final file after acceptance, or will Wiley request
this file? 
== I'm happy to change the documentation, but I don't know what Wiley will want.

For the Track Changes file, is this going to be how
the article file is submitted? Or is this just a tool for authors to
make their Response file? If we’re not going to accept Track Changes
files as the article file, we need to make that clear – authors will
need to make two files.  

 Re: Paige’s comment on inserting graphics
into the file – is this something we are going to modify GEMS to be
able to do? Is there a benefit to having GEMS do this instead of just
putting the figures at the end of the merged file as it currently
does? We could also include instructions to authors to upload their
own pdf with the figures incorporated if necessary.  
== Let me know when these things are decided if you'd like changes to the
documentation.

Otherwise, here are other things observed.  

In the documentation file (docs.pdf) 
Page 2
	Typo in ‘Setting the Documentclass Options’ section. numberline should be linenumbers 
== done

	This abovementioned typo about line numbers may be moot if we
elect to instruct authors on how to submit a final version instead of
the draft formatting (I thought we were moving away from
doublespaced/linenumbered submissions?) 
== Let me know if you need changes from me.

Page 3
	Sample author entry using \thanks{} command. Should we use an
example showing an author having a second affiliation instead of
funding? (see also below). 
== as many affiliations as wanted are allowed.

Shouldn’t funding info be captured in the
submission metadata? It can also be mentioned in the acknowledgments
right?  D.  E. Author\affil{3,4}\thanks{Also funded by Monsanto.}}
== This is the way it is shown in docs.pdf now, should anything be changed?

Page 18
Second to last paragraph contains extraneous characters (shown below)
== Fixed.
 
(Minor FYI) the topic based tabs in the documentation are not
clickable when viewing through a mobile device (android). 
== sorry! I don't think I can do anything about that.

======================================

agujournaltemplate.tex and agusuppinfosample.tex files 

I am getting an error message regarding a missing xcolor.sty file.
The new CLS file calls xcolor out specifically. I guess we can search
and download this but suspect it would be a headache for authors
unless its provided in our package. Rebecca did you get this same
error?

== No problem, I included the code found in xcolor.sty in the agujournal.cls file.

===================
Also made improvement on the track changes macros, so that now
you can add time of change or other information using []:

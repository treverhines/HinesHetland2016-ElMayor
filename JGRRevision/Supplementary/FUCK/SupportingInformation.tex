% and draft.
%
% PLEASE USE THE DRAFT OPTION TO SUBMIT YOUR PAPERS.
% The draft option produces double spaced output.

%  SUPPORTING INFORMATION TEMPLATE
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%
%Please use this template when formatting and submitting your Supporting Information.

%This template serves as both a “table of contents” for the supporting information for your article and as a summary of files.
%
%
%OVERVIEW
%
%Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript.
%In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data %tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software, in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.
%The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including %data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%
%USING THIS TEMPLATE
%
%***All references should be included in the reference list of the main paper so that they can be indexed, linked, and counted as citations.  The reference section does not count toward length limits.
%
%All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document. Insert supporting information content into each appropriate section of the template. %Figures and tables should appear above each caption.  To add additional captions, simply copy and paste each sample caption as needed.

%Tables may be included, but can also be uploaded separately, especially if they are larger than 1 page, or if necessary for retaining table formatting. Data sets, large tables, movie files, and audio files should be uploaded separately, following AGU naming conventions. Include their captions in this document and list the file name with the caption. You will be prompted to upload these files on the Upload Files tab during the submission process, using file type “Supporting Information (SI)”

%IMPORTANT NOTE ON FIGURES AND TABLES
% Placeholders for figures and tables appear after the \end{article} command, after references.
% DO NOT USE \psfrag or \subfigure commands.
%
%  Uncomment the following command to include .eps files
\usepackage{graphicx}
%
%  Uncomment the following command to allow illustrations to print
%   when using Draft:
%  \setkeys{Gin}{draft=false}
%
% Substitute one of the following for [dvips] above
% if you are using a different driver program and want to
% proof your illustrations on your machine:
%
% [xdvi], [dvipdf], [dvipsone], [dviwindo], [emtex], [dviwin],
% [pctexps],  [pctexwin],  [pctexhp],  [pctex32], [truetex], [tcidvi],
% [oztex], [textures]

\caption{Left panels show GPS time series from UNAVCO (black) and the predicted displacement (blue) from eq. (\ref{TimeSeriesModel}) for a near-field station.  Red lines indicate the times of the El Mayor-Cucapah and Ocotillo earthquake. The right panels show estimated coseismic and postseismic displacements $u_\mathrm{post}$ which are extracted from the predicted displacements.  The 68\% confidence interval is shown in light blue.}

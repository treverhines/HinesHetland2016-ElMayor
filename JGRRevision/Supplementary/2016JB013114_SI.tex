%  SUPPORTING INFORMATION TEMPLATE
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%
%Please use this template when formatting and submitting your Supporting Information.

%This template serves as both a “table of contents” for the supporting information for your article and as a summary of files.
%
%
%OVERVIEW
%
%Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript.
%In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data %tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software, in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.
%The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including %data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%
%USING THIS TEMPLATE
%
%***All references should be included in the reference list of the main paper so that they can be indexed, linked, and counted as citations.  The reference section does not count toward length limits.
%
%All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document. Insert supporting information content into each appropriate section of the template. %Figures and tables should appear above each caption.  To add additional captions, simply copy and paste each sample caption as needed.

%Tables may be included, but can also be uploaded separately, especially if they are larger than 1 page, or if necessary for retaining table formatting. Data sets, large tables, movie files, and audio files should be uploaded separately, following AGU naming conventions. Include their captions in this document and list the file name with the caption. You will be prompted to upload these files on the Upload Files tab during the submission process, using file type “Supporting Information (SI)”

%IMPORTANT NOTE ON FIGURES AND TABLES
% Placeholders for figures and tables appear after the \end{article} command, after references.
% DO NOT USE \psfrag or \subfigure commands.
%
%  Uncomment the following command to include .eps files
\usepackage{graphicx}
%
%  Uncomment the following command to allow illustrations to print
%   when using Draft:
\setkeys{Gin}{draft=false}
%
% Substitute one of the following for [dvips] above
% if you are using a different driver program and want to
% proof your illustrations on your machine:
%
% [xdvi], [dvipdf], [dvipsone], [dviwindo], [emtex], [dviwin],
% [pctexps],  [pctexwin],  [pctexhp],  [pctex32], [truetex], [tcidvi],

Trade-off curves used to determine the damping parameters $\lambda_s$ and $\lambda_\eta$ in eq. (15) of the main text.  The left panel shows the trade-off curve for the fault slip penalty parameter, $\lambda_s$.  We pick $\lambda_s$ while keeping the penalty parameter for fluidity, $\lambda_\eta$, fixed at zero.  The right panel shows the trade of curve for selecting $\lambda_\eta$, where we fix $\lambda_s$ at the chosen value from the left panel. Chosen values are indicated with the larger marker.  When picking $\lambda_s$, we try to find a good balance between the mean chi squared value, $\bar{\chi}^2$, and the size of the slip parameters, $||s||$.  Our choice of $\lambda_\eta$ is a balance between $\bar{\chi}^2$ and the size of the Laplacian of fluidity, $||\nabla \eta_\mathrm{eff}^{-1}||$.

\caption{
Checkerboard test used to asses the resolving power of the inversion in Section 3.2 of the main text.  We create synthetic data by evaluating eq. (14) with the above coseismic slip distribution and fluidity distributions. Our fluidity model has a jump from 0.0 to $10^{-18}$ Pa$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ at 60 km depth, which corresponds to a viscosity jump from infinity to $10^{18}$ Pa s.  
Our synthetic model does not include afterslip although we estimate afterslip along with coseismic slip and fluidity in this test.  We estimate these values in the same way as described in the main text and we also use the same penalty parameters.  We do not add any noise to our synthetic data meaning that the recovered model just indicates how much the regularization is influencing the solution.  Note that our ability to recover slip decreases towards the south where there is less data available.  Also note that the smoothing constraint on fluidity largely obscures the jump in the synthetic model.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.


%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

%  SIDEWAYS FIGURE AND TABLE EXAMPLES
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
% For tables and figures, add \usepackage{rotating} to the paper and add the rotating.sty file to the folder.
% AGU prefers the use of {sidewaystable} over {landscapetable} as it causes fewer problems.

\section*{Introduction}

\section*{Data Processing}

  We use continuous GPS position time series provided by University
  Navstar Consortium (UNAVCO) for Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO)
  stations within a 400 km radius about the El Mayor-Cucapah
  epicenter. Our analysis is on the coseismic and postseismic
  deformation resulting from the EMC earthquake, which we collectively
  describe as $u(t)$. We consider GPS position time series,
  $u_\mathrm{obs}(t)$, to be the superposition of $u(t)$, secular
  tectonic deformation, annual and semi-annual fluctuations, and
  coseismic offsets from sigificant earthquakes over the time span of
  this study.  The June 14, 2010 Mw5.8 Ocotillo earthquake and the
  August 26, 2012 Brawley swarm, which consisted of a Mw5.5 and Mw5.3
  event, are the only earthquakes after the EMC earthquake that
  produced noticeable offsets recorded by GPS. Although the Ocotillo
  earthquake had its own series of aftershocks (Haukson), neither
  earthquake produced transient deformation that is detectable with
  GPS. We thus model $u_\mathrm{obs}(t)$ as 
  \begin{equation}
  \begin{split}  
    u_\mathrm{obs}(t) = &u(t) + a + bt + \\
                       &c\sin(2\pi t) + d\cos(2\pi t) + e\sin(4\pi t) + f\cos(4\pi t) + \\
                       &gH(t-t_\mathrm{oc}) + hH(t-t_\mathrm{bs}).
  \end{split}
  \end{equation}
  Where $t_\mathrm{oc}$ and $t_\mathrm{bs}$ are the times of the
  Ocotillo earthquake and Brawley swarm respectively, $H(t)$ is the
  Heaviside function, and $a$ through $g$ are unknown coefficients.

  Stations which recorded signals that clearly cannot be described by
  the aforementioned processes are not included in our analysis. This
  includes stations in the Los Angeles basin, which record deformation
  that is largely anthropogenic. In order to ensure an accurate
  estimation of the secular deformation, we only use stations that
  were installed at least six months prior to El Mayor-Cucapah
  earthquake. While several stations were installed after the EMC
  earthquake to improve the spatial resolution of postseismic
  deformation \cite{S2015}, our inverse method uses postseismic
  displacements rather than velocities (e.g. Pollitz), which requires
  the knowledge of the stations preseismic position. Despite our
  inability to utilize potentially rich data, we prefer to use
  postseismic displacements rather than potentially dubious estimates
  of postseismic velocities.

  To estimate $u(t)$ we do not assume a parametric form for $u(t)$,
  (e.g. Rollins, Ergintav), but rather we model $u(t)$ as integrated
  Brownian motion and use a Kalman filtering approach to estimate
  $u(t)$ and the unkown parameters in the above equation.
  \begin{equation}
    u(t) = \int_0^t B(s) ds.
  \end{equation}
  where
  \begin{equation}
    B(t) = \int_0^t \alpha^2 w(s) ds.
  \end{equation}

This means include Since we seek to model postseismic
  deformation, which is the deformation that deviates from steady
  tectonic deformation, we only include stations which have recorded
  at least six months of deformation prior to the EMC earthquake.
  Notably, this means that we are not using the stations installed in
  Baja California imediately after the earthquake.  Our motivation f

  the tectonic deformation for these Baja stations, we

  produce transient postseismic deformation which we do not wish to
  model either mechanically or through empirical line fitting. We thus
  restrict our analysis to deformation observed six years after the
  Hector Mine earthquake, past which point postseismic deformation for
  nearfield sites occurs at an approximately steady rate
  \cite{SS2009}. When considering stations further away from the
  Hector Mine epicenter, postseismic transience persists for only
  about two years \cite{S2015}.

  epicenter.  We seek to describe deformation resulting from
  postseismic processes; although numerous GPS stations in our study
  area have recorded signals from non-tectonic processes, such as
  groundwater pumping from geothermal powerplants in the Imperial
  Valley. We identify the stations which have extraneous signals by
  assessing how well the deformation time series can be fit by a
  function consisting of a linear term to describe tectonic
  deformation, step functions at times of significant earthquakes, and
  logarithmic functions to describe postseimic deformation. Namely we

    d\mathcal H(t-t_{B}) + 
    e\mathcal H(t-t_{O})

  \end{equation}
  
  to the north, east, and vertical components of the time series,
  where $a$ through $f_i$ are free parameters.  Stations which have a
  $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom less than 1 are deemed to contain an
  extraneous signal and are not used in our analysis.

  In the interest of making our analysis computationally tractable, we
  apply a running mean over the daily GPS time series and downsample
  the data to 14 day intervals.

  We use a fault geometry from \cite{W2011}, which was determined
  using teleseismic, GPS, and InSAR data.  

  After the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, additional GPS stations were
  installed In Baja California to record postseismic deformation with
  better spatial coverage.  Two of the stations PTAX and PHJX were
  installed near the epicenter in the Cucapah Mountains.  We do not
  include these two stations in our analysis because the geometry of
  the faults that ruptured during the earthquake is more complicated
  than our assumed fault geometry \cite{O2012} and the near field
  stations would be most sensitive to error in our geometry. We also
  leave of these near field stations in order to avoid any near field
  processes which we do not consider in this paper \cite{GO2014}.

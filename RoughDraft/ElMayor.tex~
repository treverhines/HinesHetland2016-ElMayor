  Previous studies which have modeled postseismic deformation
  following the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake include \citet{P2012},
  \citet{GO2014}, \citet{S2015}, and \citet{R2015}. \citet{GO2014} was
  able to describe five months of near field ($\lesssim 50$ km from
  the epicenter) postseismic defomation observed by InSAR and campaign
  GPS with afterslip and fault contraction on the coseismically
  ruptured fault. \citet{GO2014} also noted that their preferred model
  underestimated the GPS displacements for stations $\gtrsim 25$ km
  from the rupture and suggested that it could be the result of
  unmodeled viscoelastic relaxation.  Using continuous GPS stations
  within 200 km of the El Mayor-Cucapah epicent, which consists mostly
  of stations north of the US-Mexico border, \citet{R2015} found that
  three years of postseismic deformation can be adequately explained
  by afterslip in an elastic lithosphere, albeit with an implausibly
  large amount of afterslip inferred on the least constrained southern
  most fault segment which may be acting as a proxy for distributed
  relaxation in the lower crust or upper mantle. In this paper, we
  reiterate this finding by \citet{R2015} and but note that a purely
  elastic dislocation model is incapable of describing deformation
  observed at GPS stations greater than ~200 km from the El
  Mayor-Cucapah epicenter.  

  Given the inability to describe both near and far field deformation
  with fault slip in an elastic lithosphere, \citet{P2012},
  \citet{R2015} and \citet{S2015} have explored viscoelastic
  relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle as a potential
  deformation mechanism. The lithospheric rheology is largely unknown
  and so modeling postseismic deformation with viscoelastic relaxation
  requires one to assume a rheologic model and find the best fitting
  model parameters, which is generally a computationally expensive
  nonlinear inverse problem. Consequently, a simplified structure for
  the lithosphere must be made to minimize the number of rheologic
  parameters that need to be estimated.  For example, it is commonly
  assumed that the lithosphere consits of only three homogeneously
  Maxwell viscoelastic layers, which may be an inadequate
  representation of the lithosphere
  \citep{HH2013,RG2009}. Additionally, it is necessary to make
  simplifying assumptions about the nature of afterslip.  For example,
  \citet{P2012} and \citet{S2015} assumed that afterslip does not
  persist beyond six months and one year respectively and subsequent
  displacements were assumed to be the result of only viscoelastic
  relaxation. However, it is not unheard of for afterslip to persist
  for decades after a large earthquake \citep{C2014}.  Indeed, the
  preferred viscoelastic model from \citet{P2012} underpredicts near
  field velocities, which could be indicative of unmodeled continued
  afterslip.

  All of the aforementioned studies model displacements observered at
  stations within 200 km of the El Mayor-Cucapah epicenter, while
  postseismic deformation in this region following previous
  earthquakes of similar magnitude has been observed at distances
  extended out to about 300 km \citep{F2007}. In the present study we
  examine stations within 400 km of the El Mayor-Cucapah epicenter,
  which turns out to be crucial for discerning the postseismic
  deformation mechanism.

  Clearly, both afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation are involved in
  postseismic deformation neglecting to model one of these deformation
  mechanisms could result in a biased estimate of the other.  In this
  paper we use the inverse method described in \citet{HH2015} to
  estimate the afterslip an effective viscosity necessary to describe
  the transience postseismic deformation over the first ten months
  after the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. We then form a suite of
  models which have various lithospheric rheologies but viscosities
  that are consistent with the effective viscosity estimated from the
  early postseismic deformation. Of the suite of models tested, we
  find that five years of postseismic deformation can be explained by
  a combination of sustained afterslip on the coseismicly ruptured
  fault and a Zener rheology upper mantle with viscosity that decays
  from

We briefly summarize the method below.



\section*{Data Processing}

  We use continuous GPS position time series provided by University
  Navstar Consortium (UNAVCO) for Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO)
  stations within a 400 km radius about the El Mayor-Cucapah
  epicenter. Our analysis is on the coseismic and postseismic
  deformation resulting from the EMC earthquake, which we collectively
  describe as $u(t)$. We consider GPS position time series,
  $u_\mathrm{obs}(t)$, to be the superposition of $u(t)$, secular
  tectonic deformation, annual and semi-annual fluctuations, and
  coseismic offsets from sigificant earthquakes over the time span of
  this study.  The June 14, 2010 Mw5.8 Ocotillo earthquake and the
  August 26, 2012 Brawley swarm, which consisted of a Mw5.5 and Mw5.3
  event, are the only earthquakes after the EMC earthquake that
  produced noticeable offsets recorded by GPS. Although the Ocotillo
  earthquake had its own series of aftershocks (Haukson), neither
  earthquake produced transient deformation that is detectable with
  GPS. We thus model $u_\mathrm{obs}(t)$ as 
  \begin{equation}\label{TimeSeriesModel}
  \begin{split}  
    u_\mathrm{obs}(t) = &u(t) + c_0 + c_1t + \\
                       &c_2\sin(2\pi t) + c_3\cos(2\pi t) + c_4\sin(4\pi t) + c_5\cos(4\pi t) + \\
                       &c_6H(t-t_\mathrm{oc}) + c_7H(t-t_\mathrm{bs}) + \epsilon.
  \end{split}
  \end{equation}
  Where $t_\mathrm{oc}$ and $t_\mathrm{bs}$ are the times of the
  Ocotillo earthquake and Brawley swarm respectively, $H(t)$ is the
  Heaviside function, $c_0$ through $c_7$ are unknown coefficients,
  and $\epsilon$ is noise with zero mean and variance that is assumed
  known.

  Stations which recorded signals that clearly cannot be described by
  the aforementioned processes are not included in our analysis. This
  includes stations in the Los Angeles basin, which record deformation
  that is largely anthropogenic. In order to ensure an accurate
  estimation of the secular deformation, we only use stations that
  were installed at least six months prior to El Mayor-Cucapah
  earthquake. While several stations were installed after the EMC
  earthquake to improve the spatial resolution of postseismic
  deformation \cite{S2015}, our inverse method uses postseismic
  displacements rather than velocities (e.g. Pollitz), which requires
  the knowledge of the stations preseismic position. Despite our
  inability to utilize potentially rich data, we prefer to use
  postseismic displacements rather than potentially dubious estimates
  of postseismic velocities.

  The October 16, 1999 Hector Mine earthquake, which occurred within
  our study region about 270 km north of the EMC epicenter, has
  produce transient postseismic deformation which we do not wish to
  model either mechanically or through empirical line fitting. We thus
  restrict our analysis to deformation observed six years after the
  Hector Mine earthquake, past which point postseismic deformation for
  nearfield sites occurs at an approximately steady rate
  \cite{SS2009}. When considering stations further away from the
  Hector Mine epicenter, postseismic transience persists for only
  about two years \cite{S2015}.

  We do not assume a parametric form for $u(t)$, (e.g. \cite{R2015}),
  but rather we model $u(t)$ as integrated Brownian motion, so that
  \begin{equation}
    \dot{u}(t) = \sigma^2\int_0^t w(s) ds.
  \end{equation}    
  where $w(t)$ is white noise and the variance of $\dot{u}(t)$
  increases linearly with time by a factor of $\sigma^2$. We use a
  Kalman filtering approach to estimate $u(t)$ and the unknown
  parameters in eq. \ref{TimeSeriesModel} which we describe now. 

  In the context of Kalman filtering, our time varying state vector is
  \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{X}(t) = [u(t),\dot u(t), c_0, ..., c_7]
  \end{equation}
  and eq. \ref{TimeSeriesModel} is the observation function which maps
  the state vector to the GPS observations. We initiate the Kalman
  filter by assuming a prior estimate of $\mathbf{X}(t)$ at time $t_0$ which
  has a sufficiently large covariance to effectively make our prior
  uninformed.  For each time epoch, $t_i$, Bayesian linear regression
  is used to incorperate GPS derived estimates of displacement with
  our prior estimate of the state, $\mathbf{X}_{i|i-1}$, to form a postserior
  estimate of the state, $\mathbf{X}_{i|i}$, which has covariance
  $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{i|i}$.  

  We then use the posterior estimate of the state at time $t_i$ to
  form a prior estimate of the state at time $t_{i+1}$ through the
  transition function
  \begin{equation}\label{predict}
    \mathbf{X}_{i+1|i} = \mathbf{F}_{i+1}\mathbf{X}_{i|i} + \mathbf{\delta}_{i+1} 
  \end{equation}
  where 
  \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F}_{i+1} = 
    \left[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    1           & (t_{i+1} - t_i) & \mathbf{0}\\
    0           & 1              & \mathbf{0}\\
    \mathbf{0}  & \mathbf{0}     & \mathbf{I}
    \end{array}
    \right]
  \end{equation}
  and $\mathbf{\delta}_{i+1}$ is the process noise, which has zero
  mean and covariance described by
  \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{Q}_{i+1} = 
    \sigma^2 \left[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    \frac{(t_{i+1} - t_i)^3}{3} & \frac{(t_{i+1} - t_{i})^2}{2} & \mathbf{0}\\
    \frac{(t_{i+1} - t_i)^2}{2} & (t_{i+1} - t_{i}) & \mathbf{0}\\ 
    \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}
    \end{array}
    \right].
  \end{equation}

  The covariance of the new prior state, $\mathbf{X}_{i+1|i}$, is then described by
  \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\Sigma}_{i+1|i} = \mathbf{F}_{i+1}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{i|i}\mathbf{F}^T_{i+1} + \mathbf{Q}_{i+1}.
  \end{equation}

  This process is repeated for each of the $N$ time epochs at which
  point we use Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing to find $X_{i|N}$, which
  is an estimate of the state at time $t_i$ that incorporates all $N$
  GPS observation.  Our final estimates of $u(t)$ are used in
  subsequent analysis, while the remaining components of of the state
  vector are considered nuisance parameters. In the interests of
  computational tractability, we downsample our smoothed time series
  from daily solutions down to weekly solutions.

  We illustrate the effect of filtering in figure ().  We assume a
  constant $\sigma^2$ for each station, which is chosen to be just
  large enough for the earliest transient deformation at the most
  nearfield site, P496?, to be faithfully described by the filtered
  solution.

\section*{Postseismic Modeling}
  We use a fault geometry from \cite{W2011}, which was determined
  using teleseismic, GPS, and InSAR data.  

  After the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, additional GPS stations were
  installed In Baja California to record postseismic deformation with
  better spatial coverage.  Two of the stations PTAX and PHJX were
  installed near the epicenter in the Cucapah Mountains.  We do not
  include these two stations in our analysis because the geometry of
  the faults that ruptured during the earthquake is more complicated
  than our assumed fault geometry \cite{O2012} and the near field
  stations would be most sensitive to error in our geometry. We also
  leave of these near field stations in order to avoid any near field
  processes which we do not consider in this paper \cite{GO2014}.
